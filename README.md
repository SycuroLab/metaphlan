# metaphlan

This is the main page for metaphlan snakemake pipelines. At the moment there are two  metaphlan versions 3.1 and 4 that can be used with Humann3. Metaphlan3.1 has a smaller database but it contains viruses so if you are intersted in viruses than use metaphlan3 otherwise use metaphlan4.
